# AutofacGodotDi

DI (Dependency Injection) container for Godot 4.x using Autofac with source generation for automatic method injection.

This library simplifies dependency injection in Godot projects by allowing you to mark methods with the `[Inject]` attribute. A source generator automatically creates the necessary binding code, reducing boilerplate and manual service resolution.
